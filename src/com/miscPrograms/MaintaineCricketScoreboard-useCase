Problem statement:
Design a cricket scorecard for an inning (and not full match) that will show the score for a
team along with the score of each player. You will be given the number of players the team,
the number of overs and their batting order as input. Then, we can input overs ball by ball
with the runs scored on that ball or a wicket (keeping it simple by not including wide, no
balls, boundaries and sixes)
You are expected to print individual scores for all the players from the batting side at the end
of every over. You also need to print the total score, total wickets. Essentially, you need to
keep a track of all the players, strike changes (at the end of the over or after taking singles or
3s) and maintain their scores.

Evaluation criteria:
Apart from a functioning solution, you are expected to cover edge cases and input
validations. The code should be modular and easy to extend. As they say, code is written
once and read many times; your code should be clean and easy to read and understand.
Object oriented code is desired.

Sample program output:
No. of players in the team: 5
No. of overs: 2
Batting Order for the team:
P1
P2
P3
P4
P5
